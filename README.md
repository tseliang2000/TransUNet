- [10/15/2023] ðŸ”¥ 3D version of TransUNet is out! Our 3D TransUNet surpasses nn-UNet with 88.11% Dice score on the BTCV dataset and outperforms the top-1 solution in the BraTs 2021 challenge and secure the second place in BraTs 2023 challenge. Please take a look at the [code](https://github.com/Beckschen/3D-TransUNet/tree/main) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07781).


## Usage

### 1. Download Google pre-trained ViT models
* [Get models in this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/vit_models/): R50-ViT-B_16, ViT-B_16, ViT-L_16...
```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/vit_models/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz &&
mkdir ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k &&
mv {MODEL_NAME}.npz ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz
```

### 2. Prepare data (All data are available!)

All data are available so no need to send emails for data. Please use the [BTCV preprocessed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd?usp=sharing) and [ACDC data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KQcrci7aKsYZi1hQoZ3T3QUtcy7b--n4?usp=drive_link).

### 3. Environment

Please prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

### 4. Train/Test

- Run the train script on synapse dataset. The batch size can be reduced to 12 or 6 to save memory (please also decrease the base_lr linearly), and both can reach similar performance.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
```

- Run the test script on synapse dataset. It supports testing for both 2D images and 3D volumes.

```bash
python test.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
python test.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16 --is_savenii

```
